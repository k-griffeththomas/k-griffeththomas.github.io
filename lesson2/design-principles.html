      <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
      <h3> Wonder Bread</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.wonderbread.com"> wonderbread.com </a></p>

      <img src="/lesson2/images/visual-hierarchy-mobile.png"
        alt="Visual Hierarchy of the Wonder Bread Site in Mobile Viewport">
      <p>Wonder Bread is a classic brand that knows what they want their customers to do - feed themselves with Wonder
        Bread! This is apparent through the largest font saying "Feed Your Joy" and the secondary element being the
        brand logo. The site is simple, but very strategic in how they move the viewers eye over the page using Visual
        Hierarchy in an effort to lead them where they want them to end up. </p>

      <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
      <h3> Joshua Cripp Photography</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.joshuacripps.com/"> joshuacripps.com </a></p>
      <img src="/lesson2/images/rule-of-thirds-mobile.png"
        alt="Rule of Thirds of Joshua Cripps Website in Mobile Viewport">
      <p>Photographers have the Rule of Thirds top of mind in all work they are doing since it is a solid design
        principle, so of course Joshua Cripp
        Photography's site shows a perfect example of the rule of thirds in the images placed on his site. Both images
        use the Rule of Thirds, by placing the focal points of each photograph at both the intersection and the lines of
        the
        3x3 grid which gives a professional feel and design to this site.</p>

      <h2>White Space</h2>
      <h3>Soul Honey Clothing</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.soulhoneyclothing.com/"> soulhoneyclothing.com </a></p>
      <img src="/lesson2/images/white-space-mobile.png" alt="White Space of Soul Honey Website in Mobile Viewport">
      <p>This is one of my favorite sites. It is so simple and clean. Navigating it is a breeze since they have wisely
        eliminated any potential distractions with their excellent use of white space. Soul Honey Clothing allows the
        viewer to focus
        on the few elements of the site and the actions the company wants them to take.</p>
